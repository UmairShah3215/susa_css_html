                        <p>Venture capital is an important part of the economy. It provides funding to big, risky ideas.
                            Those ideas, and the teams behind them, have changed the world. Apple, Google, Amazon.</p>

                        <p>Ideally, VC should be a meritocracy, funding the best ideas and teams. In practice, this
                            isn’t always the case. Networks play a huge role in who and what gets funded. While there
                            are many ways to help improve this reality, Susa believes it starts with who is making the
                            investment decisions.</p>

                            likely 5 hours per week during PST working hours. This program will be entirely virtual.</p>
